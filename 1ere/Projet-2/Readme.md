# This second project is a quizz game about numeral basis.

You will be asked questions like turn this number from base 2 to base 10 etc.

The basis used are : <ul><li>10</li><li>2</li><li>8</li><li>16</li><li>2's complement (8bits)</li><li>IEE754(32,64 or 128 bits)</li></ul>

You can also create your own quizz ! (It will create a file named `Quiz.txt`)

(We weren't allowed to use OOP, that's why the code is in this state)
